        <H1> What is Cyber Security </H1>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity is the measures taken by cybersecurity experts to protect digital systems from unauthorized
            access
            or cyber-attacks of various forms. These attacks are mainly aimed at stealing users' personal information,
            asking for money, or disrupting a company's business. Cybersecurity experts try to restrict the access of a
            computer to its authorized users only. They do so by finding weaknesses in the system's security which the
            attackers could exploit and informing the user to get it rectified.</p>
